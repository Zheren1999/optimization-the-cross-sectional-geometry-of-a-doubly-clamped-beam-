# optimization-the-cross-sectional-geometry-of-a-doubly-clamped-beam-
Consider the doubly clamped beam with distributed load. The cross section is constructed with two parabolic curves in the form b(y) that depend on b_t, b_w,h. Distributed load has a parabolic shape p(x) that depend on the p_max, p_min and L. The Young's modulus of the material is E, the yiels stress is sigma_y and the deflection is u(x).
